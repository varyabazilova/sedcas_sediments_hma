The AWS was installed in 2012 but almost completely destroyed in the April Gorkha earthquake (25th April 2015). 
In October 2015 the station was reinstalled with new sensors.

Pluvio stopped functionning from 2016 18th October, probably due to a wrong manipulation during the visit. Reactivated on 20th of April 2017 with the whole station.  
Full datagap between 4th January 2017 and 20th of April 2017 because of battery issue. Solved on 20th of April 2017.
Full datagap between 26th June 2017 and 18th October 2017 due to a faulty solar power cable. Solved on 18th October 2017 with the same power cable. 
Full datagap between 19th March 2018 and 19th April 2018, likely due to a brittle solar power cable. Solved on 19th April and 20th April 2018 but changing the charge controler, internal wires to battery and internal wires within solar panel cable. 
Full datagap between 16th of November 2019 and 25th of March 2020 as data was overwriting when the station was not visited in 2020 due to COVID.
RH data from 2018 onwards look different to before, i.e. the new hygrometer obviously works differently. The sensor fails after 2019-07-15.
The RHCOR column was introduced in 2015 as the original sensor was capped at 80%. Between 2014-01-01 until 2014-04-30, the RHCOR value is to be used. Elsewhere the RH column is correct throughout.

DATA PROCESSING (DATA FROM OCTOBER 2015 TO MAY 2019):
Raw data was summarized for every hour, either taking the mean, max or sum of 10 minute time series. 
e.g. for 16h the hourly sum, mean, max were calculated from measurements stored at 15:10, 15:20, 15:30, 15:40, 15:50 and 16:00
For reproducibility the code is available at https://github.com/fidelsteiner/BasicCode/tree/master/AWSprocessing 
and https://github.com/fidelsteiner/BasicCode/tree/master/timeseriesAnalysis for the hourly aggregation. The data was reprocessed with the new
code from May 2019 onwards, hence small differences in the numbers behind the comma exist until everything is reprocessed to the same format.
Max windspeed if also provided since May 2019.

Prior to summarizing the data, the following quality checks were performed: 
- shortwave radiation values larger than 2000 were replaced with NAs. 
- negative wind speed and winddirection values were replaced with NAs. 
- 0 values of RH were replaced with NAs and values larger than 100 with 100. 
- 0 values of pluvio bucket content time series were replaced with NAs.
- 0 snow depth values were replaced by NAs.

the wind direction was calculated from the wind vectors u and v (southerlies and westerlies): 
u   =-wind_speed*sin(wind_dir*pi/180)
v   =-wind_speed*cos(wind_dir*pi/180)
meanu = hourly mean (u)
meanv = hourly mean (v)

if meanu >0, then
windvec = (90-180/pi*atan(meanv/meanu)+180)
if meanu <0, then
windvec = (90-180/pi*atan(meanv/meanu))

SR50 ground distance processing: 
- ground distance values larger than the max possible distance to the ground (2.2m) were replaced by NAs.
- best quality value within 10 consecutive measurements made each hour was selected.
- measurement quality values of 0 or above 210 were replaced by NAs.

New processing code used for aggregating the data from 2022 onward:
- Written by Philip Kraaijenbrink, completely based on previous code written by Jakob Steiner
- Includes automatic appending of data and checking (and filling) time gaps
- Available at https://github.com/mountainhydrology/data-sorting
- Fixed date stamps from US format to POSIX format
